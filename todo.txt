give ending stats even if it ends due to max lines or max apis

bugs
	first line didn't download once, is this every time?

test
	second language downloading
	in order to preserve the scheduling data we may need to do some special figureing out for this

shalu
	ask if longer mp3s are better, or shorter ones
	make a smple where it says the hindi once before the en and the turkish

Information gathering
	should make cards - only available for formatted source
		is it available for apkg?
	figure out how big/how many chunks can go into a pydub audio file and make
	find out how pretty printed jsons can be used

New Functionality
	-make a confirmation of how many words will be downloaded/translated

	make optional "hint" language when making cards
		it puts a 3rd langugae in the hint automatically		

-Confirmation print
	-give remaining api requests for the day
		-this requires saving number of requests to an extenal file, along with dates

Simple
	-make an opt for showing prints
		show number of lines/max, and/or number of api calls/max
	-make exporting an audio lesson show stats
		number pased
		number rejected
	-put instructions in readme 
		by default source.txt is used
		explain the difference of formatted and not
		the the args and opts

Eventually
	-make single word mp3s out of turkish101 chunks
	-make times and digits automatically converted to words
	-look into a way to make this usable by people, at least the anki file -> audio lesson
	-allow for extra fields to be input so i can do stuff like this chart
		https://www.tutormandarin.net/en/1000-most-common-chinese-words/
		-these extra fields can go into hint and be seperated with \n
		-eventually these fields could be possible question/answers

Refactoring
	-fix variable names

Maybe
	make a combine_failed_words program
	
Misc Thoughts
	we should have an es_en dict and and en_es dict because of the querer/quiero issue
		-this means undoing some of that complicated alphabetical switch thing
		-this can be jumpstarted by flipping current dictionaries with dictionary_formatter.py
	-we should have a translate option that is 'preserve phrases that keeps chunks of text together if it is between punctuation' so we can translate entire phrases

Notes
	figure out how to tell which way a card is going
		in note, ord 0 = foreign -> english & ord 1 = english -> foreign
	last word downloaded - yenilikler

Maybe
	-check to see if video has subtitles, if it does, then find the timestamp on the first instance of each word and make the url automatically have that timestamp built in
	-run other turkish 101 stuff through here:
		single word vocab from 250 phrases(once completed)
		turkish filler words
		150 Most Common Phrases in Turkish(once completed)

do this for single words in turkish_conversation
