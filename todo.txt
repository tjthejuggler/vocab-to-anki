-Anki sentences should have pronunciation of the rarest word, if it doesn't work we should get the next rarest word. 
-We could also make every word have a pronunciation with a button for each word. 
-If there are just two words we could make them be pronounced seperately with two recordings if they don't exist together as a single recording.

-We should automatically make lists of unpronounced words, words that forvo doesn't have pronunciations for so we can request them




keep list of already attempted pronunciations so we are not requesting ones that have already failed
	do this before continuing on to save attempt numbers
