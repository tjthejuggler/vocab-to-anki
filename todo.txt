first item on unformated list doesnt download

save failed synths to a file
	right now all the failed synths from this recent list are the languages without synths and their 
			-could write a script to get the languages we cant synth
failed synth also means failed forvo too
	these words should be ignored by 

-f firststring opt should work with unformatted lists too

we should still be keeping track of the words we cant get from forvo so we dont try to get them again in situations where synth doesnt work

make output text better
	give the output the name of the file being worked on
	make something that just prints the source to a file, this is useful for anki sources and formatting
make a script that gets all 0kb pronunciation files and redownloads them
	add_lang_to_mp3 has some useful code to cycling through folders
can probably remove 3rd lang since we now have hint lang
bugs
	first line didn't download once, is this every time?

test
	second language downloading

Information gathering
	figure out how big/how many chunks can go into a pydub audio file
	find out how pretty printed jsons can be used


Confirmation print
	-give remaining api requests for the day
		-this requires saving number of requests to an extenal file, along with dates

Simple
	-make an opt for showing prints
		show number of lines/max, and/or number of api calls/max
	-make exporting an audio lesson show stats
		number pased
		number rejected
	-put instructions in readme 
		by default source.txt is used
		explain the difference of formatted and not
		the the args and opts

Eventually
	-make times automatically converted to words
	-look into a way to make this usable by people, at least the anki file -> audio lesson
	-allow for extra fields to be input so i can do stuff like this chart
		https://www.tutormandarin.net/en/1000-most-common-chinese-words/
		-these extra fields can go into hint and be seperated with \n
		-eventually these fields could be possible question/answers

Refactoring
	-fix variable names
	
Misc Thoughts
	we should have an es_en dict and and en_es dict because of the querer/quiero issue
		-this means undoing some of that complicated alphabetical switch thing
		-this can be jumpstarted by flipping current dictionaries with dictionary_formatter.py
	-we should have a translate option that is 'preserve phrases that keeps chunks of text together if it is between punctuation' so we can translate entire phrases

Notes
	figure out how to tell which way a card is going
		in note, ord 0 = foreign -> english & ord 1 = english -> foreign
	last word downloaded - yenilikler

Maybe
	-check to see if video has subtitles, if it does, then find the timestamp on the first instance of each word and make the url automatically have that timestamp built in
	-run other turkish 101 stuff through here:
		single word vocab from 250 phrases(once completed)
		turkish filler words
		150 Most Common Phrases in Turkish(once completed)

do this for single words in turkish_conversation
	TurkishClass101 Word Power Audible (in turkish_vocab)

shalu
	ask if longer mp3s are better, or shorter ones
	make a smple where it says the hindi once before the en and the turkish
