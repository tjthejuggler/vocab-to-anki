That's a good question, I have no idea, but ı'm curious to look it up later.
I took care of the daisy
two of them were cactuses.
two of them were cacti.
İ had just gotten a new job in a new city, 
and while I was deciding if I would stay there long term,
 my friend's mother allowed me to stay with her.
She can take care of other people's children as if they were her own.
The person I'm  going to speak about is my mother
My mom works at the Bazar, you can picture it as a grocery store that is in tents instead of in buildings
the thing i like the most about her
i think i got this from her
this is something i inherited from her
this is something that rubbed off on me
we can't spend time outside
we don't get to spend much time going out together
I've gotten/inherited some nice qualities from my mom
When she does something, she wants to be the best at it
My first thought when i heard the question
Everyone sees the world differently, so old people can also learn from young people
it depends on the person
old folks home
senior living center
assisted living center
Some of them like to watch tv and read newspaper
Some of them like to watching tv and reading newspaper
i can empathize with them
They try to find ways to stay busy
They don't seem as happy as they were before
This is something that I've lost about myself
The last time I was alone i studied English, this is what I've been doing with lots of my alone time lately
if it's my close friends yeah of course i would like to spend time with close friends
Having a full day alone
İ always have days alone, although my evenings are often not alone
They are gonna get bored
Or they can develop psychological problems
İt is located in the capital of turkey
They wanted to build a good place to bury him
That's why they built it
they are putting awful graffiti on the wall
They really like to destroy places
İf there are a lot of historical places in an area, then tourists will want to visit
İn my opinion it depends on the country
Some of them, such as Turkey, don't protect their historical places
they are building something near this lake and they are ruining it
When we are interested in something.
On the internet
Old people did that, and they should do the same thing
İn the afternoon my body is getting tired so i don't feel as energetic
My dream job is to be a police officer
My dream job is police to be a police woman
I'm going to tell one of my experiences
both of us hadn't eaten sushi before
so we went to a Chinese restaurant
The waiter came and we asked for him to suggest something for us to order
We ordered some sushi
he suggested we order a certain kind of sushi
He suggested a certain kind of sushi.
My boss suggested us as the team leaders when talking to the owner of the company
İ suggest taking food if you go to the park
He suggested we be the team leaders when talking to the boss
İ suggest you take food to the park
They can easily find jobs
actually they want to be doctors or nurses
When i am programming
İ can spend hours doing it, and İ don't even notice
i prefer working in the morning
because it is about technology
İt is important for countries to develop themselves
Write and modify code, design PCBs, design GUİs, systems testing
İf i am working, the boss can get hardware and supplies that İ would not be able to get on my own"
There should be something to give to the boss
Like i said, İ have only had only one experience with this kind of work, and it wasn't good
İ want to be a good engineer
she is a girl
they are a girl
i think she is 5 years old, but I'm not really sure
And so far as her personality is concerned,  she is talkative
Rome is a beautiful city, the buildings are amazing, the people are so nice, 
and so far as the food is concerned, there is nothing like it in the world
When i am at my parents house
primary school children
Students make mistakes
Wow, what a broad question, 
let's see, it really depends on how old the kid is and what their own strengths and weaknesses are. 
For example, 
when kids first go to school 
they may struggle with following simple instructions like writing the lines properly in their letters. 
As they get older they may make grammar mistakes. 
There are really so many different kinds of mistakes to be made while learning
They can feel psychological psychologically bad
hopefully the mistakes go away over time
it really depends though, 
for some people certain subjects are really difficult, 
and for them they may continue making some of the same mistakes as long as they keep trying it
İn general however, i think most of the mistakes should go away with time, especially those from early education
Sometimes it takes lots of practice to get to the point where we are no longer making a particular mistake
Actually, I don't really know..
Yes, I think people who use calculators will make fewer mistakes because it removes a lot of possible simple arithmetic mistakes.
When i go out
They are just giving phones to their kids to keep them quiet
İ think that is affecting kids imagination
