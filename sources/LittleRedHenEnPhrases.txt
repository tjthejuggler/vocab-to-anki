once upon a time 
in a farm 
the animals had nothing to eat
they were very hungry 
so they decided to cook 
the Little Red Hen 
found a wheat seed 
and rushed to tell her friends
perhaps they would help her 
plant the seed 
who will help me 
plant this wheat 
cow will you help me 
to plant this seed 
not I 
not I 
it's too sunny to do it 
Pig will you help me 
to plant this seed 
it's too sunny to do it 
dog will you help me 
to plant the seed no
then I shall do it all alone
so the Little Red Hen planted the seed
all by herself
several days went by 
there was a bright sunshine 
it rained 
the Little Red Hen decided to weed 
who will help me weed this seed 
cow will you help me 
weed the garden 
Pig will you help me 
with the garden 
the weather is too Pleasant 
okay then I will do it
so the Little Red Hen weeded and tended
as the week's went by 
the Sun ripened the wheat 
until it was ready to harvest
the wheat had grown tall and strong 
so the Little Red Hen decided to ask her friends to help her 
Thresh the wheat 
cow will you help me Thresh the wheat 
I want to rest 
in my barn today 
Pig will you help me Thresh the wheat 
I want to play
in the mud today 
dog will you help me Thresh the weed
not I not I 
I want to find my bone 
in the doghouse today 
ok then I will do it
all alone
no one helped Little Red Hen 
so once again she had to do all the work by herself
so she thrashed the wheat
after she finished 
she asked her friends
to help her 
grind the wheat into flour
who will help 
grind the wheat into flour 
cow will you help me grind the wheat into flour 
not I not I 
it's too close to milking time 
Pig will you help me grind the wheat into flour 
it is too close to suppertime
dog will you help me grind the wheat into flour
not I not I 
it is too close
suppertime 
okay then I will do it 
so the little red hen ground the wheat into flour all by herself
The Little Red Hen decided 
to bake her flour into bread 
she decided 
to give her friends another chance 
to help her
who will help me bake this flour
into bread 
cow will you help me 
bake this flour into bread 
not I not I 
I don't know how to bake 
Pig will you help me 
bake this flour 
into bread 
not I not I
I don't know how to bake 
dog will you help 
bake this flour into bread 
not
I not I I don't know how to bake
okay then I will do it 
The Little Red Hen baked the bread 
all by herself 
when it was done 
she let it cool 
for a while
before she knew it 
the time came 
to cut 
and eat the bread
looking around 
she didn't see anyone 
I wonder who will help me eat this bread 
I will I will I will
no you won't 
I did all the work 
I get the rewards 
of that work 
this bread
