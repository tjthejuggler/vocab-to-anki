yani - I mean.. - ya need to hear what I mean..
l mean.. ya knee is gone
öyle, böyle - thus, such as, in this way - you are trying to describe the way something behaves and you compare it to an oily substance
öyle yani - I mean this, this is what happened - just like böyle yani, you tell someone what happened, a boy lay on ya knee
böyle yani - I mean that, that's what happened - a boy comes and lays on your knee, and you later you are telling someone and you say "i mean that, that's what happened"
şey - uhhhh - you know you are trying to think of a thing, but you don't know what so you just say thing
ya - well.., ohhh, really? - really? is pretty much the same as in english, but since it isn't used as 'yes' slang, it also gets reused as a meaningless filler for the other words like well.. and ohh...
