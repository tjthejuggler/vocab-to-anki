the lion and the mouse 
once upon a time there lived a lion 
ruled the forest
one day after eating his meal 
the lion fell asleep under a tree 
a little mouse saw him 
thought it would be fun to play on it 
he began running up and down the sleeping lion 
he ran up the tail
the loud roar 
he grabbed the mouse 
with his huge paw 
the mouse struggled 
but could not escape the lion 
over his big jaws 
to swallow him 
the mouse was very scared 
I shall never forget it 
maybe one day I can help you
the lion was so amused 
by the idea 
of the mouse being able to help him 
he lifted up his paw 
let him go
you are lucky my friend 
I've just eaten 
now go but don't mess with me again 
I will make a meal of you 
a few days later the lion was roaming the jungle 
hunters set a trap to catch the lion
the hunters hid behind the tree 
waiting for the lion 
to approach the trap 
as he did 
the hunters pulled the ropes
the Lion started
try to escape
the hunters
they went back to the village 
to bring a cart 
to transport the lion 
the lion was still warring loudly
all the animals 
including the mouse
is in trouble 
I must
he soon reached the lion 
don't worry 
my king 
I will set you free 
he climbed up
the trap 
and used his short little teeth
finally he freed the lion 
from the trap
the lion realized 
even a little mouse 
can be a great help
Thank You mouse 
I will never trouble you again
we'll live happily
in my forest 
he saved
a king's life 
now you are the prince 
of this forest 
Thank You King 
bye see you soon
ah where are you going 
don't you want
the mouse started jumping 
on his back
sliding down his tail 
after a while
the hunters came back 
with a big cart 
to carry the lion 
the lion 
a mouse saw them
and started running towards them
gave up a big roar 
the hunters were terrified 
ran away 
back to the village 
a lion and mouse became 
friends forever
