They need a letter of permission 
Ladies and gentlemen 
And one day at dawn 
If you want we got our study group 
I don't really know Mutt 
Mr Pitts taking his time 
What if they said it was okay 
That life exists 
Well I wouldn't worry

I never kissed a bear 
Cameron asked me too 
Yeah come along pal

to a summer's day 
I can't talk to him this way

The funny thing is about this 
of MrJ Evans Pritchard 
I could not turn from 
Yes I too attended Hell ton 
telling the saddest tale 
Listen Chet's parents 
look at things in a different way 
that she was 
What will your verse be

God are you trying 
Oh but it's fine if 
But room fairy 
And he he's never asked me 
to meet enemies undaunted 
A major theme

bound for all ports 
to savour words and language 
You mean it was a bunch of guys 
outburst from you or anyone else 
Todd you're welcome to join us 
will be penalized one point 
I doubt the present administration 
And they run out of gas 
You're coming to the meeting 
and necessary to sustain life 
What are you doing 
He's all right 
All of you down 
stop chattering and sit down 
I'm Todd Anderson 
To indeed be a god 
That's not my fault 
boys his age are very impressionable 
When they realize that they're 
Well that's my boy 
a real poem 
Now devotees may argue 
and line up single file 
You can't explain it Todd 
That's not how it works 
is one day going to stop breathing 
think you know something 
You know me 
like lemmings Look around you 
You can't save Keating 
Don't you like snakes 
Get you some tea 
that the image that was formed 
I have to go 
a three course meal from one dog 
lived a man named 
From the moment we enter crying 
this book practise this rating method 
from the project list 
Oh my niece is in a play 
What about the play 
to remind myself that we must constantly 
if they could have a desk set 
paper in the name of the Dead Poets 
Come on he's your roommate 
is gonna satisfy my soul 
Now remember keep your shoulders back 
Are you kidding 
His grades are hurting 
Chet I'm coming

A A A sweaty toothed madman 
Now just to review 
We'll perforate it put it on a roll 
is not daring to me It's stupid 
What was it 
Your complete cooperation 
Read that document carefully 
He's the spitting image of his father 
Gentlemen turn to page 21

No no no As far as I'm concerned 
Looks like a stiff 
Knox you say that over and over 
Yep Chemistry My father 
No To woo women 
one of Welton's best 
We're gonna talk 
And the figure 
and dreaming of being called Doctor 
for this stroll down amnesia lane 
Gentlemen what are 
it'll just cover your face 
That's a rather 
Oh good God boy yell like a man 
just a moment 
You told him about this meeting 
See the world looks 
I wanted to live deep and suck 
Why doesn't he 
Uh to communicate 
Like father like son huh 
'Twas always thus 
They're gonna come to you and ask 
That wouldn't be a radio in your lap 
dangers of conformity 
to organize this club 
I'm in as long as we're careful 
Now I want you 
to explain the situation 
took turns reading 
They haven't moved 
How do you mean 
for worms lads 
from the past 
own beliefs in the face of others 
O me O life 
I will find them 
for main course 
you're not mine 
I don't know Neil 
we are the best 
I  I I'm not like that 
But I'm the assistant editor

all the difference 
That was an exercise to prove a point 
time to inherit the Earth 
You do admit to being a part 
O Titus bring your friend hither 
Let's go boys 
To put to rout 
Then you have to talk 
Chester School in London 
Of course So what's the problem 
Well come on 
That was a pretty lame stunt 
I mean I haven't even 
A sweaty toothed madman with 
You heard me 
and starry skies 
with their own stride their own pace 
Not a bad way 
to add or amend sign it 
I would probably 
Alfred Lord Tennyson 
Even though others may think 
and he's having a party 
Or a car 
At that point 
You don't understand Neil

You need anything you let us know 
And if he has trouble breathing 
If you pardon we will mend 
this old lady ever heard 
Are you crazy

made weak by time and fate 
I've wanted to try this

I came for my personals 
Spirits soared women swooned 
To fully understand poetry 
If the poem's score

They made everybody sign it 
Because he's in a hurry

It's part of the monastic oath 
I never kissed a goose 
It's okay Todd 
Captain of the soccer team 
What if you didn't have to read

This This kind 
Maybe they thought you needed

him from coming here and killing you 
Not a clue 
symbol for virility 
Yeah Like what 
his obsession with acting 
Have you showed him that 
of the poem been rendered 
But why do they swoon 
such separation as may well be said 
Now how's about a kiss 
Rip it out I want to hear nothing 
Then I had religion 
To advance to the muzzles of guns 
Neil I've just spoken 
Read the first stanza 
Say hello to Mutt for me okay 
and the Dead Poets Society 
uh and his image floats beside me 
Then slip I from her bum 
to think for yourselves again 
And if the rest of you are smart 
determining a poem's greatness

Hi This is Knox Overstreet

Sometime for three foot stool

They're not that different 
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may 
What are you guys doing 
Oh to have life henceforth 
Well ask yourselves 
It's going to be all right 
thought I should get ahead 
So good night 
What I want to do right now 
The point is there's nothing you can 
and self indulgent behaviour 
You were all just wonderful

To touch her 
Take centre stage 
Did you talk to your father 
Very funny Dalton 
Sorry if I shocked you Mr McAllister 
Don't you dare talk back to me 
Have a seat Mr Anderson

against the explicit orders 
Leave him alone

Mr Anderson thinks everything inside 
He knew he'll get there one day 
Could you give that back please 
We can't get caught 
an indentured servant 
He didn't like it one bit but at least 
studying his chemistry 
You have to show him 
teaching methods in your classroom 
Where did you

I wasn't going to find out 
Whoever the guilty persons are 
I am that merry wanderer

Neil Back here Neil 
Gosh they don't give you 
I'm sorry I 
a stare that pounds my brain 
Are we just playing around out here 
Oh and if he can't swallow 
But that's not the point 
I know this sounds impossible 
then I can worry about that 
You come with me tonight 
You know what I mean

The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy 
Yes this is true This is true 
Isn't that right Todd

my school and make a fool out of me 
Forget Hager No

The Danburrys will hate me 
Funny I never pegged you 
Because you see gentlemen these 
lives of quiet desperation 
score high on the vertical

in the centre of the puzzle 
In fact its shape is 
And no at that time I was not 
Excuse me Excuse me 
you must try 
like a cat or a flower or rain 
I'm hearing rumours 
Couldn't get any worse 
It was a dark and rainy night 
in front of the class on Monday 
Would you excuse us for a moment 
bring her downstage 
Hey would you not worry about 
What'd you tell 'em 
A sweaty toothed madman 
Maybe they weren't 
Radio Free America 
and try and figure out problem five 
If they catch me 
Did they wait 
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle 
Sucking the marrow out of life 
Because we are food 
Mr Anderson I think we've pretty well 
It's not a whim for you You prove it to 
Meeks aced Latin 
You don't speak for the club 
Close your eyes Close them

encouraged Neil Perry to follow 
to Neil Perry's death 
Would that he were gone 
and falls into a cough 
Chet can you get that 
I want it gone history Leave nothing 
Todd's brother was 
'Assume the position Mr Dalton 
Oh my son My son My poor son 
We were just looking 
Leave Mr Keating 
You told Nolan everything about 
Nobody knows who we are 
I made a great many sacrifices 
Don't just walk off the edge 
Can't I even enjoy the idea 
Gotta do more 
of these recurring 
about as much as you look forward 
My parents will kill me 
Before you say anything 
Armies of academics 
It shouldn't be that hard to 
what I want 
what are the Four Pillars 
Friends of my dad's They're probably 
We skipped most of that sir 
with the little paw 
I appreciate this concern 
That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invoke 
Yeah but if he said no before 
gonna be in big trouble 
Would I like to come to a party 
A good persuasion 
No No I I can't 
What's gonna happen 
I'm not saying they've had anything 
Come on Mr Overstreet

You're siding with Mr Nolan 
and on her withered dewlap 
going right up this opening 
The Latin term for that sentiment 
Mr Keating responsible for Neil 
You guys are the same way 
He wasn't happy 
What a performance 
What did you bring one

Dalton there's something 
We're trying to rehearse okay Go 
Yes that's the one 
I'll try anything once

He's making me quit the play 
on the horizontal 
To the Mighty Mutt 
Uh Dr Hager 
Chet Chet Look 
that you insist on defying us 
But won't he kill you if he finds out 
But he's planning the rest 
You can have yourself 
Chaos screaming chaos dreaming 
And then end life when I end loyalty 
Do you hear me

We're not talking artists George 
Uh I I close my eyes

but I say let Keating fry 
Why don't you go downstairs 
for perfection is plotted 
You see poetry can come from anything 
welcome to Hell ton 
But until then you do as I tell you 
What is the point 
I know what he'll say 
Don't think about it just answer 
That the powerful play 
Yawp Carpe diem 
I'm a dead poet
