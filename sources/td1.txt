The phone rings. I don't answer it. I stare at the wall, knowing that this is going to hurt. I unplug the overly thick cord from my lower back and surpress a scream. I know if I scream then this is all over, and I really do not want to start back from the beginning. My desire to see what I just removed from myself overpowers the desire to try and pretend like this isn't happening. The pain which had been delayed now floods in with a vengence. I'm about to quit.

Oh my god, you have no idea how bad I have to pee right now. The next bleaker station isn't for another 8 stops though, and if I go anywhere else then I will regret it. A lady who looks like she came straight from a a cartoon version of the distant past begins boarding the bus. I say begins because I can already tell this is going to be a long process. She has short thin curly hair, I can see her scalp from my third row seat. before opening her purse she turns and looks at me and the tree other riders and gives a friendly wave and a smile that has a hint of appology in it for the time that she knows she is about to waste for all of us.
